# Image-classification-using-CNN
Image classification performed on labeled dataset of Cats and Dogs

Data set used is - 10000 images of cats and dogs respectively
Supervised learning is used where the dataset is labeled with cats and dogs seperately.

Steps to perform the project - 
1. Simply run cnn.py file first, this file will save the weights and model into a .h5 and .json file respectively
2. Next run the loaded_model.py file to make single predictions, add the image path in the 'test_image' variable in the code


This is a simple but effective classification using Convolutional Neural Networks, it is recommended to increase the number of epochs and input_shape if training is done on a GPU.
